# Use machine learning to achieve OCR

### Introduction
This is an introduction to machine learning with a very simple OCR system on uppercase English characters.
(My OCR system only accept 17*17 files, otherwise the system will not work)

### Working Process
The Neural Network Model is the most popular machine learning model in Artificial Intelligence industry, which it is the simulation of human's neural network, the web of interconnected neurons, which contains different weights and biases.

Different neurons come up with layers to interconnect to form proper and functional neural network. There are three basic layers, an input layer, inner layers, and an output layer. At this point, all the data input into the the input layer, and use the forward methods to inner layers to process and calculate, then go into the output layer to get the final result.

The training process is very essential, which is known as the backpropagation to adjust the weights and biases in the inner layers.

### Demo
Here is the result of a successful demostration to indentify the letter "D". The image is painted in the drawing tool that comes with windows system.
